current command to verify run:

./gemc -gui=0 -n=100 -runWeightsFile=runWeights.txt  test.gcard -grunv=3 -gsensitivityv=3 -gflowv=3


need a map<gsensitiveDetectors> in the the GDetector scope so we can load the gDynamic pointer with the plugin.
GDetector should be in the main scope

gDynamicSystem
this class instance should be a shared_ptr?

sensitiveDetector should have a shared_ptr of this.
event action should have share_ptr of this

 - have all the output functions
 - dyn. loaded plugin
 - each system have their constants initialized by initializeConstants(int runno, string variation)

gruns implementation

constants mechanism: class that can be loaded as plugin dynamically. to be used by processID and by digitization.
this is thread local - each thread will load the constants?. Part of g4run? BeginOfRunAction seems the right place for this. 







read sensitivity infos:

- timewindow
- energy threshold



clock class
random number class

handle cerr, fatal errors, throw exceptions

check MT logs, remember:

# Shared classes (cout):
# - geometry and physics tables are shared: G4VUserDetectorConstruction, G4VUserPhysicsList and newly introduced G4VUserActionInitialization
# Local thread classes (g4cout):
# - EventManager, TrackingManager, SteppingManager, TransportationManager, GeometryManager, FieldManager, Navigator, SensitiveDetectorManager



runs, random seeds: examples/extended/common
class grandom is inside runAction

class gruns - how many runs, and event / run - also inside runAction - external library.
